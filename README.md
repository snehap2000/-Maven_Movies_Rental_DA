## Movie Inventory Analysis:
Explore the rental inventory and classify movies based on rental rates and availability. Provide recommendations for expanding the movie collection based on popularity and rental rates. Revenue Optimization:

Analyze rental rates to identify trends and the profitability of various pricing categories. Determine the most rented movie categories and ratings to maximize revenue.

## Operational Efficiency:
Help track and manage movie inventory effectively. Highlight gaps in the inventory and optimize stock levels.
